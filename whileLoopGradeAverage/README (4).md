## While True Loops

**Definition:** In Python, While True Loops allow a segment of code to be repeated indefinitely. These code segements can also have certain conditions that can be set in whiche the loop will only repeat if the code is True to that particular condition.

## Example

#I'm python code

while True:

    number = int(input("Enter the number grade: "))
    if number >=0 and number <= 100:
       break
    else:
       print("Error: Enter number between 0 and 100)
    print(number)
