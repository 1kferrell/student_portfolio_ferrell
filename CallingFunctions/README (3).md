## Calling Functions

**Definition:** In Python, after a function is defined by giving a name to the action or actions you want it to perform, you can call that function execute that action or set of actions. Calling functions are simply telling the computer to run those action you defined earlier in the pprogram.

## Example

#I'm python code

def add_the_numbers(num1, num2):

    addition = num1 + num2
    return addition

num1 = 2
num2 = 5
addition = add_the_numbers(num1,num2)

print(addition)
